Visualization of Titanic Survival
----------------------------------
###Summary:

The Survival rate was depends on the sex, age and cabin class. Sex was the primary factor for survival. Femal passengers got on the life boat first along with children. Second priority was your cabin class. The trend shows that very clearly. In all three class First class shows the higher survival rate. 

###Design:

When created the graph, main focus was on sex and cabin class. 

I have selected bubble graph to represent the data. "Sex" is on x-axis and number for survived passenger count on y-axis.

Next variable I use is "Age". Younger passengers survived more than older ones. I have used color hue to show the age catagory. Age is like continus variable so to make the visulization esier, I breakdown them in 5 different catagory. Children, Youth, Middle Age, Sineor and No Data.

I tried to use "Pclass" variable as third axis but its not showing properly on the map. Purpose of using bubble chart was to visulize more variables. I have used "EmbarkedCountry" variable for animation.

I modified the data and added "AgeCat" and "EmbarkedCountry" variables. I have not modified any original data. AgeCat variable is used to catogoried the age for better visualization.

Modified data was stored in train_w_age_cat.csv file.
